For my Introduction to C Programming class, we were given a project to create a program that functions as a basic vending machine. The use of pass by reference and pass by value is what enabled the different functions to come together and work as a one program. This is mainly seen with the use of the pointer 'double *balance'. The program itself relied on user input/out and control structures such as loops and the switch statement to progress throughout the program. The gretting function is meant to greet the user. The order function will collect user input input to make an order. View hand will display the amount of money in the user's wallet. The transaction function handles deals with the transactions and is proofed in case a user has unsufficient funds. Pull money will add money to the user balance. Finally the display function will display the available beverage items. Overall, this design allows the program to remain organized.
